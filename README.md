# Different-Model-Types-Review-in-R
Review of different model types for my Data mining course in R
1.	Remove all records with NA entries. Find the number of the available records or rows.

2.	Plot the dependent variable Ozone  as a function of the independent variable Solar.R 

3.	Evaluate the predictions using the following models for Ozone ~ Solar.R:

a.	Eyeball linear equation

b.	Linear model; lm

c.	Second order polynomial 

d.	Generalized linear model; glm

4.	In each case present the following: coefficient, summary statistics of the error vector, and SSE. Also include a plot that shows the response of these models.

5.	Which model is the best? And why?
